# DP_Term_Project_Codes

The repository contains two python files: 
1. stats.py for calculating the statistics of the dataset : mean and S.D. The stats.txt file shows the output from the stats.py code. We will need these values in the differential_privacy.py code.
2. differential_privacy.py for training and testing of differential privacy methodology.  

The train data is in subfolders within the images folder while the test data is in subfolders within the test folder. 
The train and test data can be obtained by first getting access to DementiaBank and WLS corpus and then asking me for the data split-up of the subjects and it's code.

Feel free to message me for any questions (I'll try my best to answer them!)
